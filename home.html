		<dt>ABOUT ME</dt>
			<dd>Welcome to Army Nomad! I am PFC Henry and I enlisted in the Army in December 2017. 
			I completed Basic Combat Training at Fort Jackson before traveling to Goodfellow Air
			Force Base in <a href=texas.html>San Angelo, Texas</a> for Advanced Individual Training. 
			After that, I got stationed in <a href=korea.html>South Korea</a>.
			While in Korea, I had the opportunity to explore the country for the entire one-year 
			tour, as well as travel to <a href=japan.html>Japan</a> and <a href=thailand.html>Thailand</a>.
			I always wanted to travel and the Army gave me the opportunity to do so! <br></dd>

		<dt>ABOUT ARMY NOMAD</dt>
			<dd>If you are an active duty service member stationed in any of the places that I have been, 
			look no further for a guide on things to do in the area! When I was initially stationed in these places, 
			I did not know the areas or what to expect; I wished there was a resource for service members to learn 
			about the local attractions, restaurants, and culture. I had
			to do a lot of research and exploring to find the best activities, but this site will save
			you time by giving direct first-hand experience. Since service members are usually stationed in places for short time periods, it is critical to make the 
			most of each opportunity and find interesting activities and sites to visit in the area. 
			Army Nomad is a personal website about the places I have traveled to since enlisting in the Army. <br>
			
			Hopefully the site will inspire others in the military to travel more and show civilians the 
			opportunities the Army can provide. </dd>
