		<dt>PHUKET</dt>
			<dd>Phuket is an island off of Thailand. One of the most popular places to 
			stay is Patong Beach where there are plenty of places for massages, partying, 
			tasting new foods, and exploring the beach! On the beach they offer parasailing 
			and other activities. Thereâ€™s a large street called Bangla Road which is a 
			strip of restaurants and souvenir shops during the day and clubs and shops at 
			night! At the end of the road is the beach which is always warm. While in 
			Phuket, you can easily take an inexpensive day trip to surrounding islands. 
			For example, I went to Koh Phi Phi, Monkey Island, and James Bond Island among 
			others. <br><br>

		<dt>BANGKOK</dt>
			<dd>Bangkok is the most iconic city of Thailand, and for good reason. Here you 
			can explore the most famous temples of Thailand and go to authentic markets to 
			get more of a genuine perspective on Thailand. My favorite temple was Wat Arun. 
			You can also get discounted tickets
			at your hotel for the zoo and floating markets. At night they have sky bars with 
			beautiful views of the city. <br><br>

		<dt>CHIANG MAI</dt>
			<dd>Chiang Mai is the rural area in the north of Thailand that many tourists 
			usually skip. However, the scenery is beautiful and it is the best place to 
			zip line. It also has sanctuaries where you can visit elephants and tigers 
			with the knowledge that they are in safe environments. <br><br>
