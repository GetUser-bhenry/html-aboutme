		<dt>KOREAN CULTURE</dt>
			<dd>Korea is a culturally rich and fun country to explore. Whether you are 
			interested in nature, temples, shopping, or clubbing, there is something in 
			Korea for you. The most important things to keep in mind are that Korea has a 
			<a href="https://www.insidejapantours.com/japanese-culture/social-conventions/">drinking culture</a> 
			and that the custom courtesy is to <a href="https://zkorean.com/about_korea/korean_customs/respect">respect elders.</a> Everyone 
			drinks- the legal drinking age is 19 in Korea, but they never check IDs. Also, 
			you will probably experience elderly Koreans cutting you in lines or expecting 
			you to move and that is because they treat their elders with a lot of respect 
			in Korean culture. Many Koreans are active, even elders, and <a href="https://www.worldnomads.com/explore/eastern-asia/south-korea/top-hiking-trails-for-an-adventure-in-south-korea">hike</a> in the 
			mountainous terrain outside of the major cities. Since you will most likely not 
			have a car for the short Korea tour, you will rely on cab drivers. Be sure to 
			annunciate yourself clearly and wear your seatbelt because they drive extremely 
			fast and only avoid tickets because of monitors in their car that tell them 
			where the speed checks are. </dd>

		<dt>SEOUL</dt>
			<dd>Seoul is a gigantic city which can’t even compare to New York because of 
			the way that businesses are stacked on top of and beside each other. It is 
			very busy, so be prepared for crowds at all times of the day and night. To get 
			to Seoul you will need to take a 50 minute train ride to Seoul station and a 
			cab to whichever area you would like to explore. <a href="https://www.theseoulguide.com/sights/neighborhoods-and-districts/myeongdong/">Myeongdong</a> is great for 
			shopping and street food. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gangnam-cheongdam-apgujeong-richest-neighborhood-south-korea-photos-tour-2018-6#i-started-my-tour-of-gangnam-on-apgujeong-rodeo-street-the-street-named-for-its-similarity-to-los-angeles-rodeo-drive-is-a-high-end-shopping-road-featuring-luxury-brands-as-well-as-many-secondhand-boutiques-dont-expect-to-find-a-bargain-at-the-boutiques-though-they-are-super-expensive-3">Gangnam</a> is the luxurious area which is also known for 
			shopping. <a href="https://dailytravelpill.com/things-to-do-hongdae-seoul/">Hongdae</a> is located near a university and has a lot of foreigners, so 
			you will not feel uncomfortable there as an American and the young, college 
			atmosphere is a plus! <br><br>

		<dt>LOCAL ACTIVITIES</dt>
			<dd>While stationed in Korea you will most likely be at Camp Humphreys. 
			Outside of Camp Humphreys is known as the “Ville.” They have all food options, 
			from fried chicken to Korean pizza to teriyaki chicken on a stick! At night is 
			when the clubs open! About 25 minutes away is Osan Air Base, which is where 
			many go to club locally. They also have a “Ville” similar to the one outside 
			of Camp Humphreys. </dd>
